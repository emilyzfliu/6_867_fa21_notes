Summaries for 6.867 Machine Learning, Fall 2021 @ MIT.

I wrote these up mostly to help me understand the course content better so some of the notes here are my own understanding. Please contact me (emizfliu@mit.edu) if there are any glaring mistakes

Will most likely upload notes for lec 1-11 later for completeness sake; not now tho I'm a very busy human

Github doesn't display LaTeX afaik but can be viewed on VSCode with the Markdown+Math plugin.
